# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About me 

🎓 I am dual bachelor student of **Computer Science & Engineering and Business Administration** at the university Carlos III de Madrid.

👩‍💻 Passionate about the transformative power of data and technology, I immerse myself in the exciting universe of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Science and Business Intelligence. My education and interest in these areas drives me to continually seek new ways to leverage information to drive innovation and digital security.

🎾 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies are playing tennis, music like playing the guitar, and building model cars.

📖 I also love reading books both to learn and to have a good time. My favourite one to learn is **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by _Aurélien Géron_. Regarding leisure, **And then there were none** by _Agatha Christie_ is my all time favourite.

🛫 Traveling is my passion. Not only I embrace new cultures but also it goes beyond mere sightseeing; it fosters personal development, intercultural understanding, and a lifelong appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the world we inhabit.
